    <h2>Scoping Styles: the &#64;scope rule</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>scope</strong> is a subtree or fragment of a document, which can be used by selectors for more targeted matching. A scope is formed by determining:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The scoping root node, which acts as the upper bound of the scope, and optionally:</li>
        <li>The scoping limit elements, which act as the lower bounds.</li>
    </ul>
